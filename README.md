# ImageConverter

This is a quick and simple image converter that allows you to convert the most common image formats to other. 

Supported formats include:
- WebP
- JPG (JPeg)
- PNG
- HEIC*

**The application only allows to convert image from HEIC to other formats, I didn't see a need to convert them to HEIC*

## Usage

![](/Capture.PNG)

To use [ImageConverter](https://github.com/briannelson95/image-converter/) you select an image from your computer using the Browse button. 
You will see a preview of the image if the format is supported under the preview is your output folder, if you don't specify a folder it will save to the file your original image is in. On the right hand side you select what format you would like to convert to and if you want to rename the file. If you don't set a name the name will be the original name of the file with the new extention. You can allow the application to open the destination folder for you by ticking the checkbox and then click Convert.
